1. Copy either the bouncer or spinner folder into your components folder.
2. Import into your project: **import Spinner from "./spinner";**
3. Use by adding the JSX-Element: **Spinner isLoading={isPageLoading} height="2rem" img={img_icon}**

## About
This code uses only regular css and no library. Have fun, clone and make it your own!

## Props
### isLoading
isLoading will display the loader whenever true. Use for example by passing a state hook like isPageLoading. If false, isLoading wont display.

### height
height uses standard css properties for height to enlarge the image eg. "2rem", "20px" and so on.

### img
img replaces the standard image of the loaders, use what ever image you like.

# Use at your own risk, I take no resposibility for anything that relates to the use or further development of this code.
